# Life expectancy in care home residents in Scotland

Estimation of life expectancy data in care home residents in Scotland

Note that in the analysis in the manuscript the actual age at death was used whereas here we provide a simulated distribution for the purposes of running the code. The simulation was created by first fitting a Weibull distribution to the age variable then sampling from the parameters of this distribution. This approach was used to prevent the identification of individuals.
